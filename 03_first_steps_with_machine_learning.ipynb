    "_Machine learning (ML) is the study of **computer algorithms** that can **improve automatically through experience and by the use of data**. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms **build a model** based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so._\n",
